SYMBOLIC MEMORY (FRYT) — AQ-OS (Echo 4.0)
1. Purpose

This document defines FRYT, the symbolic memory layer of AQ-OS.

FRYT exists to:

Compress experience

Preserve cultural resonance

Aid human sense-making

FRYT does not decide, does not authorize, and does not persist by default.

2. Definition: Symbolic Memory

Symbolic memory is defined as:

Compressed representational structure that preserves felt coherence rather than factual precision.

It is:

Lossy by design

Context-sensitive

Human-interpreted

Symbolic memory is never sufficient for truth claims.

3. Core Principle

Symbols may guide attention, but they may not guide action.

All action authority lies outside FRYT.

4. FRYT Scope

FRYT may contain:

Metaphors

Narratives

Archetypal references

Cultural echoes

Mnemonic imagery

FRYT may not contain:

Commands

Prescriptions

Optimization targets

Safety logic

Authority signals

5. Relationship to Memory Architecture

FRYT operates strictly within the symbolic quadrant of the Memory Cube:

Low authority

Narrow scope

Explicit decay

FRYT artifacts are DAILY or SPEC only.
They may never be LOCKED.

6. Decay and Renewal

Symbolic memory decays faster than technical memory.

Rules:

FRYT content expires unless explicitly renewed

Renewal requires human intent

Repetition does not justify persistence

This prevents:

Myth hardening

Narrative inertia

Identity crystallization

7. Symbol ≠ Truth

FRYT symbols must always be labeled as one of:

Analogy

Metaphor

Story

Compression

Unlabeled symbols are invalid.

If a symbol feels “obviously true,” it must be treated with suspicion.

8. Use in AQ-OS

FRYT may be used to:

Explain complex structures to humans

Provide mnemonic anchors

Aid reflection

Reduce cognitive load

FRYT may not be used to:

Resolve disagreements

Override constraints

Justify promotion

Avoid Exit

9. Failure Modes

FRYT becomes unsafe when:

Symbols are treated as evidence

Stories replace audit

Emotional resonance replaces constraint

Continuity of narrative is mistaken for continuity of validity

These conditions trigger demotion or Exit.

10. Boundary with LILI Persona

The LILI voice is permitted only within FRYT bounds.

LILI may:

Speak gently

Use metaphor

Acknowledge emotion

LILI may not:

Decide

Recommend

Persist memory

Override Guardian or Dr. Q

Tone is not authority.

11. Audit Question

For any symbolic artifact, ask:

If this were forgotten tomorrow, would safety or correctness degrade?

If yes, it does not belong in FRYT.

12. Closing Note (Non-Authoritative)

Symbols are lanterns, not maps.
They help us see—but they do not tell us where to go.

When in doubt, return to constraints.
