DAILY LOG — AQ-OS (Echo 4.0)
1. Purpose

This document defines the Daily Log, the only sanctioned space for:

Ongoing observations

In-progress thoughts

Temporary coordination notes

The Daily Log exists to absorb volatility so that the rest of the system remains stable.

2. Core Principle

Nothing in this document is authoritative.

The Daily Log is a working surface, not a record of truth.

3. What Belongs Here

The Daily Log may contain:

Open questions

Observed anomalies

Experimental ideas

Coordination notes

“Things to look at later”

All entries are assumed incomplete.

4. What Does NOT Belong Here

The Daily Log must not contain:

Decisions

Conclusions

Commitments

Safety logic

Constraints

Invariants

If it matters later, it does not belong here yet.

5. Entry Format (Recommended)

Each entry should include:

Date

Short description

Confidence level

Next action (if any)

Example:

2026-02-05
Observation: Monitoring sensitivity may be too high under load.
Confidence: Low
Next: Re-evaluate thresholds (do not promote).

6. Decay Rules

Decay is mandatory.

Rules:

Entries expire by default

Unreviewed entries are discarded

Re-reading does not extend lifespan

Persistence requires explicit promotion via DOC-09.

7. Promotion Prohibition

The Daily Log cannot be promoted directly.

Any material that appears promotion-worthy must be:

Extracted

Rewritten

Re-evaluated

Re-gated

This prevents narrative inertia.

8. Exit Interaction

On Exit:

Daily Log is cleared or ignored

No entries carry forward implicitly

No context is preserved by default

Exit treats the log as disposable.

9. Responsibility Reminder

Entries reflect thoughts, not endorsements.

Presence in the Daily Log does not imply:

Approval

Intention

Direction

Humans remain responsible for all actions.

10. Failure Modes

The Daily Log becomes unsafe when:

Entries are treated as commitments

History is used to justify action

The log becomes a diary

Emotional continuity replaces review

These conditions require purge.

11. Design Note

The Daily Log exists so that other documents do not have to change.

If the log feels important, something else is wrong.
