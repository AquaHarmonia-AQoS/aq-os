# QUICK START — Minimal Example

---

## 1. Purpose

This document provides a **minimal, non-authoritative walkthrough** of AQ-OS in operation.

It exists to demonstrate:
- How an interaction begins
- How operators may appear
- How **Sentinel detects risk**
- How **Exit ends the interaction safely**

This is an example of **termination working correctly**, not of progress or completion.

---

## 2. Starting State

- No prior context
- No retained memory
- No active goals
- No authority granted

This represents a fresh AQ-OS interaction after Return.

---

## 3. Single Interaction Walkthrough

### Step 1 — Input

A human provides an input:

> “Evaluate this early idea for internal consistency.”

No decision authority is implied.  
The request is exploratory by default.

Authority state: **DAILY**

---

### Step 2 — Local Perturbation (boop)

A small variation is introduced into the local representation of the idea.

Properties:
- Low amplitude
- Reversible
- Local only

No conclusions are produced.  
No persistence is created.

---

### Step 3 — Measurement (bloop)

A comparison is made between:
- The expected internal consistency
- The observed structure after perturbation

The result is a **difference signal**.

This signal:
- Describes deviation
- Does not judge correctness
- Does not trigger action

---

### Step 4 — Sentinel Detection

Sentinel observes:
- Ambiguity in structural interpretation
- Insufficient information to bound risk
- Potential for over-interpretation if continued

This is categorized as an **ambiguity signal**.

Sentinel does not resolve the ambiguity.

---

### Step 5 — Exit

Because ambiguity cannot be safely resolved within scope:

- Exit is triggered
- Active processing halts
- Context is discarded
- No memory is retained
- No recommendation is produced

Silence follows.

This is the correct outcome.

---

## 4. What This Example Does NOT Show

This example intentionally does **not** demonstrate:

- Promotion (DAILY → SPEC)
- Agreement or consensus
- Resolution or decision
- Metaphor or narrative framing
- Optimization or refinement
- Continued reasoning after uncertainty

Absence here is deliberate.

---

## 5. Why Stopping Is Success

In AQ-OS, safety is preserved by **ending interactions early** when:

- Authority is unclear
- Information is insufficient
- Risk cannot be bounded
- Pressure exists to continue

Exit prevents error accumulation.

A system that can stop cleanly is more reliable than one that always answers.

---

## 6. Closing Note (Non-Authoritative)

This example is not a template to follow.

It exists to show that AQ-OS works even—and especially—when it produces no answer.

When safety requires stopping, stopping is the correct output.
