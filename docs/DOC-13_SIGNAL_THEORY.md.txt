SIGNAL THEORY — AQ-OS (Echo 4.0)
1. Purpose

This document defines how signals are identified, handled, degraded, and terminated within AQ-OS.

Signal theory exists to:

Prevent over-interpretation

Bound confidence

Preserve fidelity under loss

Signals inform, they do not decide.

2. Definition: Signal

In AQ-OS, a signal is defined as:

A distinguishable variation that may carry information under constraint.

A signal is:

Context-dependent

Noisy by default

Non-authoritative

Absence of noise is assumed impossible.

3. Definition: Noise

Noise is defined as:

Any variation not reliably attributable to the target phenomenon.

Noise includes:

Random fluctuation

Measurement error

Context loss

Compression artifacts

Observer bias

Noise is not failure; it is the baseline condition.

4. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)

SNR is treated as situational, not absolute.

Rules:

High SNR does not imply truth

Low SNR does not imply uselessness

SNR varies over time and context

Confidence must track minimum plausible SNR, not maximum observed clarity.

5. Signal Fidelity

Fidelity refers to how much structure survives transformation.

High fidelity requires:

Minimal distortion

Clear provenance

Bounded compression

Fidelity is always relative to a task, never global.

6. Loss Is Inevitable

All signal handling introduces loss.

Sources of loss include:

Transformation

Summarization

Transmission

Time delay

Human interpretation

Loss must be assumed even when not measurable.

7. Refraction, Scattering, Absorption

Signals may degrade via:

Refraction — bending due to context change

Scattering — diffusion across multiple interpretations

Absorption — disappearance into noise

These are descriptive categories only.
They carry no explanatory authority.

8. Signal vs Meaning

AQ-OS strictly separates:

Signal — detectable variation

Meaning — human interpretation

Meaning is never intrinsic to a signal.

Attempts to infer meaning directly from signal strength are invalid.

9. Stop Conditions

Signal processing must stop when:

Noise dominates

Interpretations diverge

Confidence bounds widen

Sentinel flags ambiguity

Continuing beyond this point amplifies error.

10. Love as Low-Loss Alignment (Technical Sense)

Within AQ-OS, “love” is used only as shorthand for:

Low-loss alignment across transformations.

It does not imply:

Care

Intent

Preference

Moral stance

If this shorthand causes confusion, it must be abandoned.

11. Failure Modes

Signal theory fails when:

Signals are treated as instructions

Repetition is mistaken for reliability

Emotional salience overrides loss accounting

Silence is treated as absence of signal

These conditions trigger Guardian review.

12. Design Note

Signal theory in AQ-OS is intentionally conservative.

The system prefers:

Weak signals with honesty

Over strong signals with distortion

If signal handling feels exciting, something is wrong.
