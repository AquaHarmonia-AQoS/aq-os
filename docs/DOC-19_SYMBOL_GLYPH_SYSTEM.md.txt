Conflicts With:

Glyph-as-meaning assumptions

Decorative symbolism without mapping

Glyphs used to imply authority

SYMBOL & GLYPH SYSTEM — AQ-OS (Echo 4.0)
1. Purpose

This document defines the glyph system used in AQ-OS.

Glyphs exist to:

Compress information

Improve scanability

Reduce verbal overhead

Support cross-agent alignment

Glyphs do not encode truth, intent, or authority.

2. Definition: Glyph

In AQ-OS, a glyph is defined as:

A compact visual or symbolic token that maps to a formally defined structure elsewhere.

A glyph is an index, not a claim.

3. Core Principle

If a glyph cannot be expanded into formal language, it is invalid.

Expansion must point to:

Operators

Constraints

States

Documents

Otherwise the glyph is decorative and must be removed.

4. Glyph Scope

Glyphs may represent:

Operator classes

Authority states

Directional flow

Constraint presence

Status indicators

Glyphs may not represent:

Decisions

Values

Intent

Emotion

Identity

5. Rotation & Compression Logic

Glyphs may support rotation or orientation to encode limited variation.

Rules:

Rotation must map to a defined dimension (e.g. state, direction)

Maximum of four orientations unless explicitly documented

Orientation changes do not change authority

Rotation is compression, not transformation.

6. Canonical Mappings (Examples)

Examples only; glyph set is extensible under SPEC.

□ — Kernel-level construct

△ — Flow-level construct

○ — Monitoring / Sentinel

∅ — Null / Exit / Absence

These mappings have no authority outside their definitions.

7. Glyphs and Agents

Glyphs are designed to be:

Human-readable

Agent-readable

Language-agnostic

They support:

Fast parsing

Shared reference

Reduced ambiguity

They do not replace documentation.

8. Relationship to FRYT

Glyphs may appear in FRYT contexts for mnemonic use.

However:

FRYT may not reinterpret glyph meaning

Glyph meaning must always defer to formal docs

Mnemonic use does not imply semantic flexibility.

9. Failure Modes

The glyph system fails when:

Glyphs are treated as self-explanatory

Visual appeal overrides clarity

Glyphs are used to persuade

Glyphs imply hidden knowledge

Any of these require rollback or simplification.

10. Change Policy

New glyphs require:

Formal definition

Explicit mapping

Documentation update

Review for ambiguity

Undocumented glyphs are invalid.

11. Design Note

Glyphs exist to reduce words, not replace thinking.

If a glyph feels powerful, it is being misused.
