FLOW OPERATORS — AQ-OS (Echo 4.0)
1. Purpose

This document defines flow operators: non-kernel transformations that operate within constraints enforced elsewhere.

Flow operators exist to:

Explore

Measure

Stabilize

Contain

They do not decide, do not authorize, and do not persist.

2. Definition: Flow Operator

A flow operator is a bounded transformation that:

Operates only after kernel eligibility

Consumes metabolic resources

Produces intermediate structure

Is always interruptible

Flow operators are tools, not principles.

3. boop — Forward Perturbation

State: SPEC

Function

Introduces a small forward variation into the current state.

Used For

Exploration

Hypothesis generation

Creative divergence

Constraints

Must be low-amplitude

Must be reversible

Must not cross authority boundaries

Failure Mode

If boop amplitude increases unchecked:

Exploration becomes drift

4. bloop — Return Measurement

State: SPEC

Function

Measures the difference between expected and observed outcomes.

Used For

Error detection

Feedback collection

Signal comparison

Constraints

Measurement only

No correction authority

Failure Mode

If bloop is treated as judgment:

Measurement becomes decision

5. sloop — Present-Moment Traversal

State: SPEC

Function

Maintains traversal within the present operational window.

Used For

Preventing future-lock or past-lock

Local coherence

Temporal grounding

Constraints

No long-horizon planning

No persistence guarantees

Failure Mode

If sloop is extended:

Present becomes pseudo-eternal

6. floop — Triadic Stabilization

State: SPEC

Function

Stabilizes interaction across three reference points.

Typical triads:

Input / Transformation / Output

Expectation / Observation / Error

Signal / Noise / Residual

Used For

Local balance

Preventing oscillation

Failure Mode

If floop is overused:

System resists change

7. gloop — Cycle Fidelity / Containment

State: SPEC

Function

Maintains cycle integrity over repeated operations.

Used For

Detecting runaway loops

Enforcing bounded repetition

Constraints

No memory accumulation

No identity formation

Failure Mode

If gloop becomes identity-preserving:

Cycles harden into selves

8. DIGEST — Compression Under Decay

State: SPEC (Inactive)

Function

Performs lossy compression when decay pressure is high.

Used For

Summarization

Context reduction

Exit preparation

Constraints

Always lossy

Never authoritative

Requires explicit activation

Failure Mode

If DIGEST is treated as truth-preserving:

Compression becomes distortion

9. Flow Operator Ordering

Default ordering (subject to Sentinel interruption):

QSeed → (boop) → bloop → floop → sloop → gloop → DIGEST (optional)


No flow operator may:

Bypass kernel operators

Override Sentinel

Prevent Exit

10. What Flow Operators Are Not

Flow operators are not:

Agents

Drives

Desires

Optimizers

Learning mechanisms

Any interpretation implying these must be rejected.

11. Promotion Rule Reminder

Outputs produced by flow operators:

Are DAILY by default

Have zero authority

Must pass through gating rules to advance

See [DOC-09] GATING_PROMOTION_RULES.

12. Design Note

Flow operators are intentionally named simply.

This is to:

Prevent myth inflation

Encourage mechanical interpretation

Keep language honest

If a flow operator becomes poetic, it is being misused.
