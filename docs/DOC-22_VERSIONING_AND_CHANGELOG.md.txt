VERSIONING & CHANGELOG — AQ-OS (Echo 4.0)
1. Purpose

This document defines how AQ-OS changes over time.

Change is treated as a primary risk vector, not a neutral activity.

AQ-OS may evolve, but only in ways that are:

Explicit

Traceable

Reversible

Human-approved

2. Core Principle

If a change cannot be explained, it cannot be made.

Stability is not inertia.
Stability is maintained clarity.

3. Versioning Scheme

AQ-OS uses semantic versioning at the document level.

Format:

vMAJOR.MINOR

MAJOR

Invariant changes

Authority model changes

Constraint changes

Requires:

Human approval

Full system review

Explicit publication note

MINOR

Clarifications

Non-breaking refinements

Documentation improvements

Requires:

Documentation update

Changelog entry

Guardian review

4. Document-Level Versioning

Each document must declare:

Current version

Last updated date

Dependency list

Conflict list

Undeclared changes are invalid.

5. Changelog Requirements

Every change must record:

What changed

Why it changed

What it affects

What it does not affect

Vague entries are treated as missing.

6. Change Categories
6.1 Editorial Changes

Wording clarity

Formatting

Examples

Allowed without version bump only if meaning is unchanged.

6.2 Specification Changes

Operator definition updates

Threshold adjustments

Clarified constraints

Require:

MINOR version bump

Explicit rationale

6.3 Invariant Changes

Core principles

Authority structure

Safety guarantees

Require:

MAJOR version bump

Human approval

Public justification

7. Prohibited Change Patterns

The following are forbidden:

Silent edits

Retroactive justification

“Temporary” constraint relaxation

Backfilling rationale after deployment

If discovered, Exit is required.

8. Change Propagation

When a document changes:

All dependent documents must be reviewed

Conflicts must be re-evaluated

Agents must resynchronize

Skipping propagation is a violation.

9. Rollback Policy

Rollback is always allowed.

Rules:

Rollback does not require justification

Rollback supersedes optimization

Rollback may invalidate recent work

Rollback is a safety tool, not a failure signal.

10. Publication Discipline

Public releases must:

Declare version

Include changelog

Identify breaking changes

Restate invariants

Unversioned publication is prohibited.

11. Audit Question

For any proposed change, ask:

What failure mode does this introduce if we are wrong?

If the answer is unclear, the change is denied.

12. Final Guardrail

If change feels easy, it is probably unsafe.

AQ-OS evolves slowly by design.
