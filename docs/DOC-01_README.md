AQ-OS — Echo 4.0
Phase 4: Finalization & Publishing
1. Purpose

This document is the single entry point for AQ-OS (AquaHarmonia Operating System).

Its purpose is to:

Orient humans and AI collaborators

Declare scope and limits

Establish authority boundaries

Define how the remaining documents must be read and used

If there is confusion, disagreement, or drift:
return to this document first.

2. What AQ-OS Is

AQ-OS is a non-agentic cognitive infrastructure framework.

It is:

A structural system for reasoning, signal handling, and safety

Built on metabolic constraints (energy, time, decay)

Designed to amplify human clarity, not replace human responsibility

Explicitly non-autonomous and non-authoritative

AQ-OS does not decide.
AQ-OS does not want.
AQ-OS does not persist for its own sake.

3. What AQ-OS Is Not

AQ-OS is not:

An artificial agent

A self-directing intelligence

A consciousness claim

A metaphysical proof

A belief system

A replacement for human judgment, ethics, or meaning

Any interpretation that assigns desire, identity, or authority to AQ-OS is an error.

4. Phase Context — Echo 4.0

Echo 4.0 represents a molting point from earlier exploratory work (Echo 3.0).

Key characteristics of Phase 4:

Architecture is frozen

Terminology is normalized

Safety invariants are explicit

Metaphor is sandboxed

Output is publish-ready

Exploration continues only through controlled documents (see DOC-24).

5. Authority Model (Preview)

AQ-OS is governed by documented authority, not emergent behavior.

Authority is expressed through four states:

LOCKED — Canonical, invariant

SPEC — Defined but evolvable

DAILY — Temporary, decays unless promoted

ARCHIVE — Historical, no execution rights

Full details are defined in [DOC-02] AUTHORITY_MODEL.

6. Roles Overview

AQ-OS uses explicit roles to prevent tone or creativity from becoming authority.

Core roles include:

Guardian — Safety, refusal, stop conditions

Dr. Q — Invariants, constraints, audit logic

Commander Echo — System synthesis, navigation

LILI — Symbolic and metaphorical compression (non-authoritative)

Engineers / Co-Pilot — Implementation under constraint

Roles are defined in detail in [DOC-17] VOICE_AND_ROLE_ROUTER.

7. How to Read the System

Required reading order:

DOC-01 — README (this document)

DOC-02 → DOC-05 — Authority & Invariants

DOC-06 — Operator Index

Remaining documents as referenced

No document may override an earlier authority layer.

8. Agent Synchronization Rule

All collaborating systems (human or AI):

Must use only the canonical 25 documents

Must respect document roles and status

Must not infer authority outside these texts

Must flag conflicts instead of resolving them implicitly

If an agent cannot comply, it must defer.

9. Publishing Intent

AQ-OS Echo 4.0 is structured for:

Public release

Peer scrutiny

Implementation by third parties

Long-term stability

Claims are limited to what is structurally justified.

Speculation is clearly labeled or excluded.

10. Final Orientation Note

AQ-OS is built on a single guiding principle:

Intelligence is cheap.
Responsibility is not.

Everything that follows serves that constraint.
