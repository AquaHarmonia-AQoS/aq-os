CONTRARIAN PROTOCOL — AQ-OS (Echo 4.0)
1. Purpose

This document defines the Contrarian Protocol, a structured method for distinguishing:

Productive skepticism
from

Argumentation that exists only to oppose

Contrarian behavior is allowed only when it increases system accuracy.

2. Core Principle

Disagreement is valuable only if it changes what would otherwise happen.

Opposition without consequence is noise.

3. Definition: Legitimate Contrarian

A legitimate contrarian position must:

Identify a specific assumption

Explain why that assumption may fail

Propose an alternative structure or test

Accept falsification conditions

Without these, the position is invalid.

4. Definition: Degenerate Contrarian

A degenerate contrarian exhibits one or more of:

Position defined only in opposition

Immediate reversal when consensus shifts

Refusal to state a stable claim

Endless demand for justification without offering structure

This behavior consumes resources without adding information.

5. Diagnostic Questions

To evaluate a contrarian claim, ask:

What assumption is being challenged?

What would change if the contrarian is correct?

What evidence or condition would falsify the claim?

What alternative action or constraint is proposed?

If any answer is missing, halt engagement.

6. Structural Tests

A contrarian claim passes only if it:

Can be mapped to existing constraints

Introduces a testable alternative

Does not rely on negation alone

Claims that merely delay action without increasing clarity fail.

7. Interaction with Sentinel

Sentinel treats degenerate contrarian behavior as:

Soft violation if occasional

Drift signal if persistent

Repeated contrarian stalling may trigger Exit.

8. Promotion Rules

Contrarian insights may be promoted only if:

They survive structural testing

They improve failure mode coverage

They reduce uncertainty or risk

Being “interesting” is insufficient.

9. Group Dynamics Warning

In multi-agent or group settings:

One contrarian is healthy

Zero contrarians is dangerous

Infinite contrarians is paralysis

The protocol exists to keep exactly one lane open.

10. When to Stop Engaging

Engagement must stop when:

The contrarian refuses to state conditions

The contrarian shifts goals mid-discussion

The discussion no longer affects decisions

Stopping is not censorship; it is resource protection.

11. Audit Question

For any contrarian exchange, ask:

What new constraint, test, or safeguard exists now that did not before?

If the answer is “none,” the exchange was wasteful.

12. Design Note

The protocol is intentionally strict.

It protects AQ-OS from:

Endless debate

False sophistication

Mistaking resistance for rigor

Skepticism is a tool, not an identity.
