ARCHIVE — AQ-OS (Echo 4.0)
1. Purpose

This document defines the Archive, the terminal state for AQ-OS materials.

The Archive exists to:

Preserve lineage

Support audit

Contain retired material safely

The Archive has zero execution authority.

2. Core Principle

Nothing in the Archive is active.

Presence in the Archive means:

It does not run

It does not decide

It does not influence outcomes

Archive is memory without metabolism.

3. What Belongs in the Archive

The Archive may contain:

Retired operators

Deprecated metaphors

Superseded documents

Historical notes

Prior versions

These items are preserved as artifacts, not options.

4. What Does NOT Belong in the Archive

The Archive must not contain:

Active constraints

Safety logic

Live operators

Working drafts

Unreviewed material

If something might still matter, it does not belong here yet.

5. Archive Semantics

Archive semantics are read-only.

Rules:

No execution

No promotion

No automatic reintroduction

No implied endorsement

Archive content is inert by definition.

6. Reintroduction Rules

Reintroducing archived material requires:

Explicit extraction

Rewriting as new material

Full review under current constraints

New document ID or version

Archived material cannot be “revived.”

7. Archive and Memory Decay

Archive content does not decay internally.

Instead:

It is decoupled from operation

It has no metabolic cost

It is ignored by default

Forgetting is achieved by non-reference, not deletion.

8. Audit Use

Archive may be used to:

Trace design evolution

Understand past decisions

Diagnose historical failure modes

Archive may not be used to:

Justify current design

Argue precedent

Claim inevitability

History is context, not authority.

9. Access Discipline

Accessing the Archive must be deliberate.

Rules:

No automatic lookup

No default inclusion

No blending with active docs

Archive access should feel slow and manual.

10. Failure Modes

The Archive becomes dangerous when:

It is mined for justification

Old ideas bypass current gates

Nostalgia replaces audit

“We used to…” arguments appear

These conditions indicate governance failure.

11. Final Guardrail

The Archive remembers so the system does not have to.

AQ-OS remains safe by letting the past stay past.
