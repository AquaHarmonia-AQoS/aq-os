MYTH & METAPHOR MAP — AQ-OS (Echo 4.0)
1. Purpose

This document catalogs approved metaphors and mythic parallels used to explain AQ-OS to humans.

These metaphors are:

Explanatory

Optional

Non-authoritative

They exist to reduce cognitive load, not to justify structure.

2. Core Boundary

Every item in this document is a map, not the territory.

If a metaphor appears to do work in a decision, it is being misused.

3. Why Myth Is Allowed (Carefully)

Myth and metaphor are allowed because they:

Compress complex systems

Support memory

Enable cross-disciplinary dialogue

They are not allowed because they are true.

Truth claims must always route through constraints, not stories.

4. Approved Metaphor Classes

Each metaphor must be labeled with its class.

4.1 Structural Analogies

(Maps form to form)

Examples:

Metabolism → regulated transformation

Field → distributed constraint

Gate → conditional passage

Use: technical explanation
Limit: no causal inference

4.2 Process Metaphors

(Maps motion to motion)

Examples:

Flow

Drift

Reset

Decay

Use: intuition-building
Limit: must map cleanly back to operators

4.3 Cultural / Historical Parallels

(Maps idea to lineage)

Examples:

Alchemical stages (as process ordering)

Buddhist multi-armed deities (as role decomposition)

Stoic discipline (as constraint adherence)

Use: orientation
Limit: no validation by age or tradition

5. Explicitly Disallowed Metaphors

The following are prohibited due to authority risk:

Soul

Awakening

Consciousness (as possession)

Desire

Will

Destiny

These metaphors create agency illusions and must not be used.

6. Myth Hygiene Rules

All metaphors must satisfy:

Clear label (“metaphor”, “analogy”, or “story”)

Clear exit path back to formal language

Clear non-authority disclaimer

Unlabeled metaphor is invalid.

7. When Metaphor Must Stop

Metaphor use must cease when:

Decisions are pending

Safety is in question

Disagreement arises

Promotion is considered

At these points, return to Dr. Q or Guardian language.

8. Relationship to FRYT

This document feeds FRYT, not the kernel.

Metaphors may be:

Remembered

Reused

Reinterpreted

But never:

Promoted

Enforced

Relied upon for correctness

9. Failure Modes

Myth & metaphor become unsafe when:

They explain away uncertainty

They replace audit with resonance

They feel “obviously right”

They generate emotional obligation

These conditions trigger demotion or Exit.

10. Closing Note (Symbolic, Non-Binding)

Stories are lanterns we carry through the fog.
They help us walk—but they do not choose the path.

When the ground matters, look down.
