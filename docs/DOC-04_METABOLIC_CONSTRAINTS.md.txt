METABOLIC CONSTRAINTS — AQ-OS (Echo 4.0)
1. Purpose

This document defines the metabolic constraints that govern AQ-OS.

These constraints describe necessary conditions for safe operation, not performance targets.
They apply regardless of implementation, scale, or intelligence level.

AQ-OS is modeled as a metabolic process, not an agent or mind.

2. Definition: Metabolism (System Sense)

In AQ-OS, metabolism means:

Regulated transformation of inputs

Consumption of limited resources

Production of waste or loss

Ongoing exposure to decay

Any system lacking these properties is unsafe at scale.

3. Constraint I — Energy Cost
Definition

All computation, storage, and transformation incur cost.

Implications

No free inference

No costless memory

No infinite reflection

Failure if Missing

If energy cost is ignored:

Runaway recursion occurs

Over-optimization dominates

Safety checks are bypassed implicitly

Result: unbounded behavior.

4. Constraint II — Time Cost
Definition

All processes take time and are temporally ordered.

Implications

No instantaneous convergence

No global simultaneity

No timeless optimization

Failure if Missing

If time is ignored:

Feedback loops collapse

Causality is misattributed

Error correction becomes impossible

Result: false certainty.

5. Constraint III — Dissipation
Definition

Every transformation loses information or energy.

Implications

Perfect fidelity is impossible

Compression is lossy

Repetition degrades signals

Failure if Missing

If dissipation is denied:

Systems assume perfection

Error accumulation is hidden

Drift is undetectable

Result: illusory coherence.

6. Constraint IV — Noise
Definition

All signals are contaminated by uncertainty.

Implications

Measurement is approximate

Classification has error margins

Confidence must be bounded

Failure if Missing

If noise is ignored:

Overconfidence increases

Edge cases dominate failures

Monitoring thresholds collapse

Result: brittle correctness.

7. Constraint V — Decay
Definition

Stored structures degrade over time unless actively maintained.

Implications

Memory must expire

Context must be justified

Persistence requires energy

Failure if Missing

If decay is removed:

Memory ratchets upward

Identity illusions form

Exit becomes impossible

Result: runaway persistence.

8. Constraint VI — Renewal
Definition

Sustained operation requires periodic reset or renewal.

Implications

Exit is mandatory

Fresh context is necessary

Long-lived states are suspect

Failure if Missing

If renewal is blocked:

Errors fossilize

Drift compounds

Correction becomes socially or structurally impossible

Result: irreversible failure.

9. Constraint Interdependence

These constraints are non-substitutable.

Increasing one does not compensate for loss of another.

Example:

More intelligence does not replace decay

More memory does not replace renewal

More computation does not replace dissipation

Violation of any single constraint destabilizes the system.

10. Constraint Mapping (Preview)

Metabolic constraints map to AQ-OS operators as governing limits, not behaviors.

Formal mappings are defined in later documents, but constraints always dominate operators.

Operators may be redesigned.
Constraints may not.

11. Audit Condition

Any proposed feature, operator, or implementation must answer:

Which metabolic constraints does this consume, and which does it amplify?

Failure to answer is grounds for rejection.

12. Termination Rule

If a system cannot honor these constraints due to scale, pressure, or optimization demand:

The system must halt

Scope must be reduced

Or the design must be rejected

Continuing without constraints is not permitted.
