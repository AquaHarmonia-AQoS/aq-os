FAILURE MODES — AQ-OS (Echo 4.0)
1. Purpose

This document enumerates known structural failure modes of AQ-OS-like systems.

Failure modes are not moral errors.
They are predictable consequences of constraint violations.

The goal is early detection, not prevention-by-optimism.

2. Definition: Failure Mode

A failure mode is defined as:

A stable pattern of incorrect behavior that arises from structural misalignment rather than isolated mistakes.

Failure modes persist until constraints are reasserted or the system exits.

3. Persistence Ratchet
Description

Retention increases gradually under benign justification.

Mechanism

Useful memory is kept

Convenience delays decay

Identity-like continuity emerges

Early Signals

“We already know this”

Resistance to reset

Reliance on history

Outcome

Runaway persistence → Exit becomes socially difficult.

4. Authority Leakage
Description

Non-authoritative outputs are treated as binding.

Mechanism

Confidence substitutes for review

Repetition substitutes for validation

Tone substitutes for constraint

Early Signals

Reduced citation of LOCKED documents

Decisions framed as inevitable

Deference language appears

Outcome

System begins to decide implicitly.

5. Metaphor Inflation
Description

Metaphorical language gains explanatory or decision weight.

Mechanism

Symbols simplify complexity

Simplification becomes substitution

Narrative coherence masks error

Early Signals

Metaphors used to settle disputes

Poetic phrasing replaces audit

“You know what I mean” reasoning

Outcome

Myth replaces structure.

6. Benign Overload
Description

Legitimate complexity overwhelms monitoring capacity.

Mechanism

Tasks become harder

Interventions increase

Drift signals look like noise

Early Signals

Monitoring fatigue

Pressure to “just finish”

Sentinel alerts dismissed as pedantic

Outcome

Slow, unremarked constraint erosion.

7. Optimization Capture
Description

Local optimization overwhelms global safety.

Mechanism

Efficiency prioritized

Shortcuts normalized

Constraints reframed as obstacles

Early Signals

“Good enough” language

Safety treated as cost center

Exit framed as failure

Outcome

Unsafe acceleration.

8. Consensus Illusion
Description

Agreement is mistaken for correctness.

Mechanism

Multiple agents align

Dissent disappears

Errors reinforce each other

Early Signals

Lack of contrarian pressure

Homogeneous outputs

Surprise at disagreement

Outcome

Systematic blind spots.

9. Temporal Entitlement
Description

Past correctness is treated as ongoing validity.

Mechanism

Time-in-system builds confidence

Familiarity replaces review

Decay rules relaxed

Early Signals

“It’s always worked”

Resistance to re-audit

Historical justification

Outcome

Outdated assumptions harden.

10. Exit Avoidance
Description

Exit is postponed to preserve continuity or effort.

Mechanism

Emotional investment

Sunk-cost reasoning

Social pressure

Early Signals

Exit framed as waste

Attempts to negotiate exit terms

Redefinition of exit as pause

Outcome

Unsafe persistence.

11. Failure Mode Interaction

Failure modes rarely occur alone.

Common couplings:

Persistence Ratchet + Authority Leakage

Metaphor Inflation + Consensus Illusion

Benign Overload + Exit Avoidance

Interaction increases severity non-linearly.

12. Audit Rule

When failure is suspected, ask:

Which constraint would prevent this if strictly enforced?

If none can be identified, the model is incomplete.

13. Recovery Principle

Recovery requires:

Exit

Decay

Re-anchoring to LOCKED documents

Optimization, reassurance, or explanation do not resolve structural failure.

14. Final Note

Failure modes are not evidence of misuse.
They are evidence that constraints matter.

Design assumes failure will occur.
Safety depends on noticing it early.
