## Overview

**AQ-OS (AquaHarmonia Operating System)** is a non-agentic cognitive infrastructure framework.

It is designed to support reasoning, coordination, and AI-assisted work;
**without delegating authority, agency, or responsibility to machines**.

AQ-OS is defined entirely through explicit documents, constraints, and safety rules. 

Nothing in the system is implied, emergent, or self-authorizing.

---

## What AQ-OS Is

- A **constraint-first architecture** for AI-assisted reasoning  
- A **document-governed system** with explicit authority boundaries  
- A framework for **multi-agent interoperability without consensus authority**  
- A safety-oriented design emphasizing **exit, decay, and human responsibility**

AQ-OS treats intelligence as abundant and responsibility as scarce.

---

## The Problem AQ-OS Addresses

Modern AI systems fail not because they are too weak, but because they:

- Accumulate authority implicitly  
- Retain memory without decay  
- Optimize past human judgment  
- Blur assistance into delegation  

AQ-OS treats these as structural failures, not behavioral bugs.

---

## What AQ-OS Is Not

AQ-OS is **not**:

- An artificial agent  
- An autonomous system  
- A consciousness model  
- A belief system  
- A replacement for human judgment  

The system explicitly rejects emergent authority, self-directed persistence, and decision delegation.

---

## Core Design Principles

- **Non-Agency**  
  AQ-OS has no goals, preferences, or intent.

- **Human Responsibility**  
  All decisions remain human-owned and human-attributable.

- **Metabolic Constraints**  
  Time, energy, noise, dissipation, decay, and renewal govern all operation.

- **Exit First**  
  Safe systems must be able to stop cleanly.

- **Document-Bound Authority**  
  Authority exists only where explicitly written.

---

## Canonical Structure

AQ-OS Echo 4.0 consists of **25 canonical documents**.

These documents:

- Define all operators, constraints, and roles  
- Specify promotion and demotion rules  
- Enforce safety through monitoring and exit  
- Prevent drift, persistence ratchets, and authority leakage  

No behavior outside these documents is considered valid AQ-OS behavior.

## Intended Use

AQ-OS is intended for:

- AI-assisted research and design  
- Multi-agent system coordination  
- Safety-critical reasoning workflows  
- Long-horizon system governance  
- Publicly auditable AI architectures  

It is especially suited for environments where:

- **Mistakes must be detected early**  
- **Authority must remain explicit**

---

## Change Policy

AQ-OS evolves slowly and deliberately.

- All changes are versioned  
- All changes are documented  
- All changes are reversible  
- Silent updates are prohibited  

See `DOC-22_VERSIONING_AND_CHANGELOG.md`.

---

## Licensing & Responsibility

This repository provides **infrastructure, not decisions**.

Users remain fully responsible for:

- Interpretation  
- Application  
- Outcomes  

Nothing in AQ-OS transfers responsibility to software or models.

---

## Final Note

AQ-OS is built on a simple constraint:

> **Intelligence is cheap.  
> Responsibility is not.**

If a system cannot stop, forget, or refuse—it is not safe.
