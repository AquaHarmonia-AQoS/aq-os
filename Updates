AQ-OS Echo 4.1 is a minor clarification release focused on usability and safety, not new capabilities. 

This update adds a minimal Quick Start example to show how the system safely stops under uncertainty,
introduces execution profiles that clarify operator constraints for implementers without prescribing behavior,
and tightens boundaries around metaphor so explanation never substitutes for structure. No core invariants,
authority rules, or exit mechanisms were changed. 

Echo 4.1 exists to reduce ambiguity, lower onboarding friction, and make misuse easier to detect—by clarifying
how the system ends conversations correctly, not by making it answer more often.
